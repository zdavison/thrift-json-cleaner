Thrift JSON Cleaner
==================

This is a tool to help you clean up, read, and work with thrift JSON responses.
It can be helpful to change your serverside thrift code to return JSON keynames, rather than ID (You can change this in your protocol).

All you need to do is put your JSON response in, and you will get JSON out with cleaner/easier to read paths, with all of the Thrift messaging junk removed.

Whole thing runs in your browser, so just open index.html to use.
